# Fused backlog transitions for the scripts that own a task's physical record.
# Usage: . bin/jg-tasks-axi-lib.sh; . bin/jg-backlog-transition-lib.sh
# (this library reads that one's backend gate and never sources it itself, so a
# caller that already sourced it keeps its memoised compatibility verdict).
#
# INVARIANT. In ordinary successful lifecycle state, `state/<id>.meta` exists
# <=> this home's backlog row for <id> is In flight; the one teardown crash
# window is represented by `state/<id>.backlog-close`. The script performing the
# mechanical record change owns the paired backlog transition and runs it in the
# same process, under the per-task meta lock it already holds, before it reports
# success. Nothing else - not a later agent turn, not a printed reminder - is
# load-bearing for the pairing.
#   bin/jg-spawn.sh      meta published => `tasks-axi start`
#   bin/jg-teardown.sh   meta removed => `tasks-axi done`, or `tasks-axi reopen`
#                        with the deliverable recorded when the row is still an
#                        open captain call (bin/jg-captain-hold.sh `open`), so
#                        cleanup never retires the captain's own question
#   bin/jg-bootstrap.sh  replays whatever a crash left behind, THIS HOME ONLY.
# bin/jg-fleet-snapshot.sh's classifier and bin/jg-squad-lead-reconcile.sh's
# cross-home nudge stay defense in depth, not the primary mechanism.
#
# SCOPE. jg_backlog_transition_applies is the single gate. It excludes
# squad_leads (persistent agents are never backlog items, the fleet-records skill),
# homes whose configured backlog backend is manual and markdown homes that keep
# no backlog file. Those return-1 exemptions are never errors; an
# unresolvable configured data directory, a backend resolution error, or
# incompatible tasks-axi instead returns 2 so callers refuse before mutation.
#
# ADDRESSING. Every call runs from the configured data directory's parent so
# that home's `.tasks.toml` supplies the adapter selection, done_keep, and the
# archive path. A markdown backlog also passes `--file <data>/backlog.md` so the
# change lands in the home that owns the task regardless of the caller's working
# directory. A configured non-markdown adapter is addressed by that root alone,
# because `--file` would override the adapter's own workspace path. The parent of
# the data directory is the addressing root rather than JG_HOME, so a home whose
# data directory is relocated keeps its backlog and its archive together. A root
# with no `.tasks.toml` gets tasks-axi's built-in defaults.
# bin/jg-tasks-axi-lib.sh owns backend precedence and configuration failures.
#
# CRASH RECOVERY. Only teardown needs a durable record: it removes the meta and
# with it the completion links, so a process killed between the two halves would
# leave nothing to reconstruct the close from. It writes
# `state/<id>.backlog-close` first, and removes it once the close lands.
# The writer and replay share one complete-record validator, and teardown stages
# that record before destructive cleanup, so it never publishes or acts on a close
# replay would reject. The validator pins the data path to this home's configured
# root before any recovery mutation, then re-runs exactly that close.
# While matching task metadata still exists, a scratch registry (including a
# symlink) or data/<id>/ directory blocks replay before metadata removal: rerun
# teardown to finish process and scratch cleanup instead of losing ownership.
# `tasks-axi done` on an already-closed task backfills links
# without moving the close date, so replay is idempotent. Spawn needs no marker:
# it publishes the meta first, so a crash
# leaves the meta itself as the evidence that the row is owed a start.
# A captain-held row uses the same record with a `mode=retain` line: replay then
# records the deliverable and reopens the row instead of closing it, and never
# closes a row that reads as an open captain call. An answer that closes the row
# first applies any supported retained artifact from the validated record, then
# replay simply retires the record.

# supervision instructions, fleet state and context sections ever print. The
# bound turns that into a loud partial reconcile: the caller reports the item it
# could not read and moves to the next one.
#
# A per-item bound alone is not enough on a home carrying a large fleet, because
# N wedged items still cost N bounds and the digest is truncated anyway. So the
# first bound hit latches JG_BACKLOG_ROW_SHOW_WEDGED and every later read in the
# same sweep returns immediately, still naming its own item so nothing is
# silently skipped. This function only READS that latch: it runs inside a
