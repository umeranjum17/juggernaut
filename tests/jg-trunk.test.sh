# Integration test for bin/jg-trunk.sh: the local trunk flow end to end against real git
# repositories, a local bare origin, the real gate chain and a stub for the captain-hold reader.
# This suite owns landing, going live and the release; the check, the gates and the queue are in its two siblings.
#
# T1 A one-commit lane lands on the trunk by compare-and-swap and is logged, but landing never goes live: live
#    refuses without the captain's recorded word, runs the hook at the green commit with it, and spends the word.
#    The green pin moves only when verify (the whole suite, after the landing) passes.
# T2 Every unsafe landing refuses and leaves the trunk where it was: a second commit, a conflicting change (it names its
#    paths), a failing gate, a failing lint, an owner-guard hit, a red trunk, away mode, a ref a lane moved, a
#    decision still open on linked work, a protected path, and a commit with no ticket reference.
# T3 The seams are the only place behaviour changes: protected-landing=gate and away-landing=allowed
#    let the same commits land, with no code change; the gate commands are policy keys with fast defaults.
# T5 The release is ONE PR from the trunk itself into the default branch: no release branch, no
#    force, refused without the captain's word, and a second release while it is open opens no
#    second PR; an empty batch, a red trunk and an unverified tip refuse.
# T8 Only the lander moves the trunk: a hand write to it is refused by the hook the trunk installs;
#    land records the same merged event as the local merge.
# T9 The trunk is safe until its release PR lands: no write rewinds, forces or deletes it, even the lander's
#    own; once the release merged, the next trunk version (trunk-v2) is cut from the default branch, recorded,
#    and landed on, with the old trunk untouched; while it is open, nothing rolls over.
# T10 Once the next trunk is cut, the old one is cleaned up unforced - remote branch, local branch, worktrees - only
#    when its release is proved on main and every hotfix is carried into the new trunk; a copy holding
#    unlanded work, or a hotfix not carried, keeps it, listed.
# T6 A red CI pins the home back to the last green live commit and stops landings; a worker
#    cannot record the captain's word.
# tests/jg-trunk.test.sh, tests/jg-trunk-check.test.sh and tests/jg-trunk-queue.test.sh split one local trunk flow into three
# suites that each stay inside the fast set's weight limit; tests/jg-trunk-fixture.sh holds the fixture they share.
# The done-done journey journeys/trunk-landing.sh runs all three and seals their output.
