# and a process group that were both provably gone could not be cleared:
# reconcile kept reporting a start while nothing ever attached, and retire
# refused with "cannot release source ownership". Reservation records are keyed
# by claim token and a replacement always claims a fresh one, so they can never
# collide with the generation that replaces them - they are hygiene, not an
# ownership invariant, and they must not veto an ownership move that the
# documented promise already grants.
#
# The claim below is the modern shape (it carries the state-root identity block
# a legacy claim does not have), which is why the existing dead-generation case

# were broken, in ways that hid each other:
#
#   - The stop held the per-source lock across its wait while the runner's own
#     exit cleanup waited for that same lock, so the runner outlived the ordinary
#     signal every time and the forced kill silently became the normal path.
#   - The escalation re-derived ownership from the leader, so once the leader did
#     die to the stop's own signal it read that success as a leaderless group and
#     refused to escalate at all.
#
# With only the first repaired, the second turned every stop of a signal-proof
# child into a refusal that left it running. They are asserted together because
# they only hold together.
#
# Earlier fixtures include TERM-resistant children and deliberately kept-alive
# leaders. The cases below also exercise escalation after TERM ends the leader.

# Millisecond clock for supplementary retirement and stop-window measurements;
# the healthy-stop verdict below requires attached-start status 143 (TERM).

# intervals slip under this deadline on a lucky alignment. So the lease is
# synchronized to the guard's own FIRST observed lease read, every later real
# read is recorded, and the case then REFUSES unless one of those reads proves
# the required phase: fresh, before expiry, and late enough that two further
# full intervals could not finish before the deadline.

# what an earlier version of this case did, and it is not enough: the day

# --- one unreadable read still does not end a live runner --------------------
#
# The bound above was tightened by moving the guard's two reads closer together,
# NOT by dropping the second one. This is what that second read is for, asserted
# separately so the two cannot be traded for each other by accident: against a
# home that is still alive, an isolated failed read must not stop the runner.
#
# The failure is injected where the real path actually reads. ONE lease read
# fails, exactly once, identified by the lease-age program's own text so no
# other call in the runner is touched; every read before and after it is the
# real command, and the home's lease stays long and fresh throughout. The single
# failed read is therefore the only thing wrong that the guard can see.
